## Review

**mean** : average of a list of data values 
$$\bar x = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} x_i}{n}$$

**median**: the middle value when the data are ordered

---

**sample variance**: average square distance from the mean. It measures variability of the data.
$$s^2 = \frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}$$


**sample standard deviation**: average distance of a data value from the mean. Square root of the variance. 

$$s = \sqrt{s^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma_{i = 1}^{n} (x_i - \bar x )^2}{n-1}}$$

We can use multiple functions inside `summarize()`. 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mean(calories), 
          median(calories),
          var(calories),
          sd(calories),
          min(calories),
          max(calories))
```

---

class: middle

We can use create variable names for the output (e.g. `mean_cal`). 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mea_cal = mean(calories), 
          med_cal = median(calories),
          var_cal = var(calories),
          sd_cal = sd(calories),
          min_cal = min(calories),
          max_cal = max(calories))
```

We can use the pipe operator with the `summarize()` function. 

```{r}
summarize(fastfood, 
          mea_cal = mean(calories), 
          med_cal = median(calories),
          var_cal = var(calories),

          min_cal = min(calories),
          max_cal = max(calories))
```

We so far have been summarizing data numerically. 
In grouped data, we often want to do this for each group (e.g. left vs. right handed people, first-years vs. sophomores vs. juniors vs. seniors. etc.).

---


class: middle

`group_by()`

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data-wrangle.003.jpeg")
```

`group_by()` separates the data frame by the groups. Any action following `group_by()` will be completed for each group separately.


---

Notice that the output indicates `Groups:   restaurant [8]`

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant)
```


---

```{r}
fastfood %>% 
  group_by(restaurant) %>% 
  summarize(med_calories = median(calories),
            mean_calories = mean(calories))
```
